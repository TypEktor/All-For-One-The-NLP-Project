# All-For-One-The-NLP-Project
---

This repository contains a homemade Python library that includes a set of functions for dealing with text cleaning and preprocessing. The goal was and still is, to create a All For One function for interactively dealing with the two aforementioned tasks.

Over time this library will grow arms and legs and will include more sophisticated methods and also it will become part of a full NLP pipeline. This means that more functions will be created for dealing with the last task of an NLP pipeline, which is the Machine Learning one.
